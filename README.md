 # ðŸ§¬ Cell Annotation with Single Cell RNA-seq

Single-cell RNA-seq data are designed to measure the activity (or expression) of a set of genes within a single cell at a specific point in time. The resulting data is a high-dimensional vector of integer values, where each dimension represents the expression level of a particular gene, measured by the number of corresponding RNA molecules found in the cell.

In this [notebook](https://github.com/mahossam/cell_type_classification_scrna_seq/blob/main/Cell_Type_Classification_using_Transformers.ipynb) we train two baseline classifiers and a self-attention transformer to classify cells by their cell type using single-cell RNA-seq data. Please refer to the notebook for the experiments and model implementations.
